### Ruby_bash_helper

I always found my self writting aliases to make my life easier.
It became messy as soon as I needed to execute AppleScript in it.
So, in order to keep on with ruby & rspec a bit I did this project.

For now it is only for one project and what it does is:
- Going into the right directory
- Running the gulp command
- Going in the project root directory
- Openning it with vim
- Openning an another tab in the project root directory

I hope I'll make it grow for other projects!

#Technologies

- Rspec
- Osascript
